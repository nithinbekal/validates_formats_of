ValidatesFormatsOf
==================

A plugin which allows you to validate formats of urls and emails without
having to specify the regular expressions.

This is just some code I wrote to try and understand how to create plugins, and
it hasn't been tested at all. I will try to improve this, but for now you can
use a couple of excellent plugins for validating urls and emails:

http://github.com/henrik/validates_url_format_of/
http://github.com/dancroak/validates_email_format_of/

The validates_url_format_of plugin by henrik played a large role in getting me
started with this plugin. The #validates_url_format_of method is almost
identical to that plguin, but since this isn't a serious plugin (yet), I've used
a very simple regexp for url format.
